# Todo
- Improve the human demonstration script so that actions are more in line with what we want and get video observations into the pipeline.
- Work on the CNN based diffusion architecture.
- VRAM/computation speed optimization
- Loss curves are low, but deceptive. MSE may not be a good loss because with large N and loss highly based in certain params causes a vanishing gradient?
- Flatten the observations and actions in output instead of doing the whole 2d input, output thing I'm doing right now
